### POSTMAN COLLECTION

After you successfully installed yarn and run the app, you can find a collection to import to \
Postman, so you can test all the APIs. The Postman collection is in the root folder of the project. 

#### AFTER COLLECTION IMPORT
Almost all APIs are protected, so you first need to log in using these credentials:\
`matteo.adduci94@gmail.com`\
`1234567890` \
or you can register a new user.

Once you have your credentials, use the `login` API to get a token.
Once you have the token, you need to update the collection `auth` variable. After that you can start 
to user all the protected APIs.
